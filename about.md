Alon created [Emscripten](http://emscripten.org) and [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) and works on compiling to the Web, in particular to [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/).

History will remember him as partially to blame for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asmjs">asm.js</a> and completely to blame for [some bad music](https://soundcloud.com/alon-zakai).
