Alon created [Emscripten](http://emscripten.org) and [Binaryen](https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen) and co-created [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org/).

History will remember him as partially to blame for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asmjs">asm.js</a> and completely to blame for [some bad music](https://soundcloud.com/alon-zakai).

Works at Google. Previously: Mozilla, [Syntensity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J8KMwU1UJmw), [mathy stuff](http://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume10/zakai09a/zakai09a.pdf). The opinions stated here are my own, not those of my company.
